  Think of a light switch. It has two settings, On and Off. That is exactly what
  the switch component is like.

### â€‹â€‹â€‹âš™ Properties <a id="styles"></a>

* **Generic properties**
  * **Enable** [**skeleton loaders**](../../estilos/skeleton-loader.md)**:** this tool provides an indication to the user that something is coming but not yet available on the switch element.
  * **Control is hidden:** hide the switch element from the screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [**skeleton loader**](../../estilos/skeleton-loader.md) component provides a user with a visual indicator that content is coming/loading. This is better received than traditional full-screen loaders.
{% endhint %}

### â€‹â€‹ðŸ‘† Events <a id="events"></a>

* **On value change:** called ****with a new value when the value changes.
